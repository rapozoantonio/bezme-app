## Our Mix-Making Mission

At Bezme, we're building something different. While traditional communities connect like-minded individuals, we're about **Mix-Making** – deliberately bringing together diverse creators and founders to spark innovation through unexpected connections.

Our platform exists to break existing limits by introducing you to new industries, cultures, and ideas. We believe the most transformative insights happen at the intersection of different worlds, and we've designed our entire experience around this principle.

## Core Values

Our community is built on these fundamental values:

- **Curiosity** – Approach each connection with genuine interest in perspectives different from your own
- **Creativity** – Seek unexpected connections across disciplines and domains
- **Generosity** – Share your knowledge, network, and resources openly
- **Respect** – Honor diverse viewpoints and experiences
- **Growth** – Embrace discomfort as a pathway to expanding your horizons

## Platform Safety & Moderation

To maintain our unique environment, we employ both advanced systems and human moderators to ensure all interactions remain safe, respectful, and aligned with our values.

While we strive for vigilance, we can't oversee every action. These guidelines help create a framework for positive engagement both on our platform and during in-person meetings.

Violations may result in warnings, account restrictions, meeting bans, or in severe cases, permanent removal and potential involvement of authorities. Report concerns to **support@bezmezhhub.com**.

## Profile Requirements

Your profile is your introduction to our community. To ensure meaningful connections:

- **Age**: You must be 18+ to participate. Age verification may be required
- **Identity**: Use your real name and current photo (without excessive filters)
- **Authenticity**: Your project/venture description should accurately reflect your work
- **Verification**: Valid email and phone number are required
- **Uniqueness**: One account per person – multiple accounts are prohibited

## Meeting Protocols

The in-person meeting experience is central to Mix-Making. To protect this experience:

### Before Meetings

## The Mix-Making Mindset

Beyond rules, Mix-Making thrives when members embrace these attitudes:

- **Intellectual Humility**: Recognize the limitations of your knowledge and perspective
- **Bridging Divides**: Actively seek to understand viewpoints different from your own
- **Constructive Discomfort**: Welcome the productive tension that comes from diverse perspectives
- **Collaborative Innovation**: Build on others' ideas rather than competing with them
- **Lifelong Learning**: Approach each interaction as an opportunity to grow

## Account Management

- **Temporary Restrictions**: Limited platform access for a defined period
- **Meeting Bans**: Prohibition from in-person gatherings while maintaining digital access

- **Permanent Removal**: Deletion of account without option for return

Bezme reserves final judgment on all enforcement decisions. While we consider appeals (submitted to support@bezmezhhub.com), we cannot guarantee review of all removal decisions.

## The Spirit of Mix-Making

More than just guidelines, Mix-Making is a practice. It thrives when you:

- Approach each new connection with genuine openness
- Listen more than you speak
- Look for unexpected applications of ideas across different domains
- Embrace being a beginner in unfamiliar territory
- Share your unique perspective generously
- Connect dots that others might miss

By joining Bezme, you're not just agreeing to these guidelines – you're embracing a philosophy that meaningful innovation happens at the edges of our comfort zones, where different worlds collide.
